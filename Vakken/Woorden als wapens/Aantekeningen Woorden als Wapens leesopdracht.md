Introduction to discourse studies

Chapter 8 delves into the concept of style and its various interpretations within the field of stylistics. Here is a summary of the key points:

**8.1 Introduction**

- Style refers to the different ways in which the same thing can be expressed in language.
- The word "style" has its origins in the Latin word "stilus," which means pen.
- Style encompasses both the form of letters and how words are formulated.
- The analysis of style draws from classical rhetoric and focuses on the appropriate linguistic forms for conveying a message in a given context.
-  style can be defined in three possible ways: 
		as a potential form for a particular content,
		as the text producer’s choice of specific forms, 
		or as a deviation from the recipient’s expectation


**8.2 Form, Content, and Situation**

- Style's historical roots can be traced back to classical rhetoric, which emphasizes effective language use to persuade in specific situations.
- Style has a history of about 2,500 years.
- Aristotle and Quintilianus discussed the importance of style, with an emphasis on correctness, perspicuity, appropriateness, and ornamentation.
- Style analysis explores how different forms can express the same content.
	- **"The starting point for stylistic research is that the same content can be ex- pressed in different forms."**
- Different style variations: telegram style (the channel factor), city hall style (the setting factor), and court ruling style (the genre factor)
- Style and register are not the same thing whilst being often used without distinction.

b. Because Mary is ill, John does not go to school. 
c. Mary is ill. So, John does not go to school. 
d. John does not go to school. Mary is ill.

**8.3 Views on Style**

- There are three main perspectives on style: a. Style as a possible form for specific content. b. Style as the choice of specific patterns by writers or speakers. c. Style as a deviation from reader/listener expectations.
- Each perspective presents challenges in defining and understanding style.
- The style-as-deviation approach considers how language forms can deviate from readers' or listeners' expectations, leading to stylistic judgments.

The chapter highlights the complexities of defining and analyzing style, with a focus on the interplay between form, content, and reader/listener expectations. It also acknowledges the importance of considering situational factors and the role of norms in stylistic analysis.
