Introduction to discourse studies

Chapter 8 delves into the concept of style and its various interpretations within the field of stylistics. Here is a summary of the key points:

**8.1 Introduction**

- Style refers to the different ways in which the same thing can be expressed in language.
- The word "style" has its origins in the Latin word "stilus," which means pen.
- Style encompasses both the form of letters and how words are formulated.
- The analysis of style draws from classical rhetoric and focuses on the appropriate linguistic forms for conveying a message in a given context.

**8.2 Form, Content, and Situation**

- Style's historical roots can be traced back to classical rhetoric, which emphasizes effective language use to persuade in specific situations.
- Style has a history of about 2,500 years.
- Aristotle and Quintilianus discussed the importance of style, with an emphasis on correctness, perspicuity, appropriateness, and ornamentation.
- Style analysis explores how different forms can express the same content.

**8.3 Views on Style**

- There are three main perspectives on style: a. Style as a possible form for specific content. b. Style as the choice of specific patterns by writers or speakers. c. Style as a deviation from reader/listener expectations.
- Each perspective presents challenges in defining and understanding style.
- The style-as-deviation approach considers how language forms can deviate from readers' or listeners' expectations, leading to stylistic judgments.

The chapter highlights the complexities of defining and analyzing style, with a focus on the interplay between form, content, and reader/listener expectations. It also acknowledges the importance of considering situational factors and the role of norms in stylistic analysis.

8.1-8.3

 style can be defined in three possible ways: 
	as a potential form for a particular content,
	as the text producer’s choice of specific forms, 
	or as a deviation from the recipient’s expectation
