J.L. Austin - theory of speech acts


Perfomative Utterances
	Constatives (are declerative utterances expressing some state of affairs)
	Example: 
	a. She walked out.
	b. Mr. Ward was on his feet, hat in hand.
	c. Mr. Ward obeyed, staring at him.

Constative utterances
- whose utterance does not bring about the act they describe.


Performatives (are used to perform an act {not express a stat affairs})
	Example:
	a. I apologize to Mrs. manor and all other whose sensitivities were offended by my reference to sauerkraut on hot dogs. Put anything you want on a hot dog. It is your right as an American. And I promise to never again make snide remarks about sauerkraut on hot dogs. Or even ketchup, although Dirty Harry once said that only a (obscenity) would use Ketchup.
	b. Mike Royke apologized to Mrs. Manor.
	c. Mike Royke is promising not to make snide remarks about sauerkraut on hot dogs.

(first-person pronoun subject)
a. Keep trying to get his office. 
b. Sit down
- Performative utterance (examples)


  
One test for whether an utterance is a performative utterance is the word !Hereby!
a. I hereby apalogize to Mrs. Manor.
b. I hereby promise to never again make snide remarks about sauerkraut on hot dogs.

Hereby: by means of this/by virtue of this
