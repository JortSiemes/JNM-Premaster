What did they mean by that? (is waar pragmatiek om draait)








































































H1
- The paragraph introduces pragmatics as a field concerned with understanding what people mean beyond the literal words and sentence structure.
- Pragmatics looks at context, the speaker, and the listener to interpret meaning, including implied intentions and inferences.
- It emphasizes that people often convey more than their literal words suggest, and listeners need to figure out these additional meanings.
- The difference between the literal meaning (semantics) and intended or inferred meaning (pragmatics) will be the main focus of the chapter.
- The chapter will also cover research methodologies in pragmatics, the domains of semantics and pragmatics, and competing models of the semantics/pragmatics boundary.
- The discussion will help establish a shared background and vocabulary for further exploration in the chapter.

H1.1 - Linguistics is the scientific study of language.
- It encompasses the study of phonology (sound systems), morphology (word structure), and syntax (sentence structure).
- There's a distinction between competence (knowledge of language rules) and performance (actual linguistic behavior with errors and hiccups).
- Pragmatics focuses on language use in context, different from semantics (literal meaning).
- Pragmatic knowledge, like other linguistic competencies, is rule-governed.
- Pragmatic competence is implicit and guides interpretation, making it tricky to study.
- Figure of speech interpretation can shift from pragmatic to semantic meaning over time.
- This has real-world implications, like in legal contexts.
- Pragmatics deals with non-literal, context-dependent, inferential, and non-truth-conditional meanings.
- It concerns how an utterance's meaning can change in different contexts and to different people.


H1.2
- Language use involves a connection between form and meaning.
- The study of linguistic form encompasses several levels: Phonetics (individual speech sounds), phonology (systematic sound patterns), morphology (word structure), and syntax (sentence structure).
- At each level, forms may correlate with meanings:
    - Phonetics/phonology: Intonational contours are associated with specific meanings, studied in prosody.
    - Morphology: Individual words and morphemes are conventionally linked to meanings, studied in lexical semantics and lexical pragmatics.
    - Syntax: Certain sentence structures are conventionally tied to meanings, as seen in sentence semantics.
- Above the sentence level, we enter the realm of pragmatics, where meaning is inferred based on context rather than convention.
- Pragmatics shares common ground with discourse analysis, as context is part of both fields.
- Pragmatics uses discourse data to create generalizations about linguistic competence, while discourse analysis focuses on specific discourse instances to explore how interlocutors use and interpret language in a given context.
- In summary, discourse analysis asks, "What's happening in this discourse?," while pragmatics inquires, "What happens in discourse?" Pragmatics generalizes from natural language data, while discourse analysis uses those generalizations to investigate language in context.

H1.3
- The study of pragmatics, like all linguistics, is descriptive rather than prescriptive, focusing on how language is actually used.
- Linguists do not dictate how people should use language but observe and describe language usage.
- The terminology in pragmatics might appear prescriptive, but it describes what speakers typically do, not what they should do.
- Linguists use three main methods to study language use and variation:
    1. Native-speaker intuitions: The researcher's own intuition helps form initial hypotheses, but it becomes unreliable once a hypothesis is in place.
    2. Psycholinguistic experimentation: Tests people's linguistic knowledge and behavior outside their ability to manipulate it, like lexical decision tasks and eye tracking.
    3. Naturally occurring data: Observes language in natural conditions, including elicitation, natural observation, and corpus data.
- Intuitions can be unreliable for pragmatic research, making it important to examine spontaneous language use.
- Researchers must ensure their data is appropriate to their hypothesis.
- Pragmatics research often relies on the study of naturally occurring data because of the nature of the field.
- Hypotheses must be falsifiable and predictive to be scientifically interesting. Falsifiability means there is a way to test if a claim is false. Predictive claims make generalizations about language use.
- Empirical (testable) and generalizable claims about language use are scientifically interesting and constitute part of native speakers' linguistic competence.
