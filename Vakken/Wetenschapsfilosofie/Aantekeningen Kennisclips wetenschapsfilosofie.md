1.1
**What is an argument?**
terminologie:
Argument consists of 2 parts:
- [[Premises]], what we presuppose
- [[Conclusion]], what we conclude from the [[Premises]]


VALID Argument:
[[Premises]]: No medieval king had absolute power over his subjects.
[[Premises]]: Louis VII of France was a mediaval king.
[[Conclusion]]: So, Louis VII of France did not have absolute power over his subjects

INVALID Argument:
[[Premises]]: No medieval king had absolute power over his subjects.
[[Premises]]: Louis VII of France had a horse.
[[Conclusion]]: So, Louis VII of France did not have absolute power over his subjects

[[Deductive argument]]:
An valid argument in which the truth of the [[Premises]] absolutely guarantees the truth of the [[Conclusion]]. Impossible for [[Premises]] to be true where [[Conclusion]] is false

[[Inductive argument]]:
An argument where the truth of the [[Premises]] gives good reason to believe the [[Conclusion]], but does not absolutely guarantee the truth of the [[Conclusion]]. Possible for [[Premises]] to be true where [[Conclusion]] is false.


No A is B
C is A
So C is not B

1.2

Example [[Inductive argument]]:
[[Premises]]: I put 25 frogs in the freezer for a week, and all of them died.
[[Conclusion]]: So, all frogs die when they are put in the freezer for a week.

Inductive always needs background theory, to know if it is correct.

[[Representative Data]]:
Data that represent the subject matter as a whole, and not just a special part of it.

1.3

[[Confirmation Bias]]:
The tendency to collect and take seriously evidence that supports our beliefs, and to disregard or ignore evidence that confilcts with our beliefs.

[[Correlation]] and [[Causation]]
[[Correlation]]: the tendency of two things to occur together
[[Causation]]: the relation between causes and effects

[[Correlation]] does not imply [[causation]].
