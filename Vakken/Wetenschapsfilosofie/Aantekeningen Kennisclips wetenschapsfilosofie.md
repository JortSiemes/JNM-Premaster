1.1
**What is an argument?**
terminologie:
Argument consists of 2 parts:
- [[Premises]], what we presuppose
- [[Conclusion]], what we conclude from the [[premises]]


VALID Argument:
[[Premises]]: No medieval king had absolute power over his subjects.
[[Premises]]: Louis VII of France was a mediaval king.
[[Conclusion]]: So, Louis VII of France did not have absolute power over his subjects

INVALID Argument:
[[Premises]]: No medieval king had absolute power over his subjects.
[[Premises]]: Louis VII of France had a horse.
[[Conclusion]]: So, Louis VII of France did not have absolute power over his subjects

[[Deductive argument]]:
An valid argument in which the truth of the [[premises]] absolutely guarantees the truth of the [[conclusion]]. Impossible for [[premises]] to be true where [[conclusion]] is false

[[Inductive argument]]:
An argument where the truth of the [[premises]] gives good reason to believe the [[conclusion]], but does not absolutely guarantee the truth of the [[conclusion]]. Possible for [[premises]] to be true where [[conclusion]] is false.


No A is B
C is A
So C is not B

1.2

Example [[inductive argument]]:
[[premises]]: I put 25 frogs in the freezer for a week, and all of them died.
[[Conclusion]]: So, all frogs die when they are put in the freezer for a week.

Inductive always needs background theory, to know if it is correct.

[[Representative Data]]:
Data that represent the subject matter as a whole, and not just a special part of it.
