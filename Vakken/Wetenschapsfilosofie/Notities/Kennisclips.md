# Chapter 3.3: [[Hegel]], the logic of History


G. W. F. Hegel

Agrees with Romantics
"nobody can escape from its own time to take a position outside of history."

This can be the same for philosophy and science.

People in future will think different in future
So science will also be different.


Cannot reach eternal truths.

"philosophy is its own time captured in thought"
