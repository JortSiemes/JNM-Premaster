Wetenschapsfilosofie - curriculum geesteswetenschappen

Doel:
- in staat te zijn met een aantal medestudenten te reflecteren op en te discussiÃ«ren over de aard van geesteswetenschappelijk onderzoek; 
 - inzicht te hebben verworven in de aard van wetenschap in het algemeen en van de geesteswetenschappen in het bijzonder; 
-  vertrouwd te zijn geraakt met de belangrijkste stromingen die in de debatten over de geesteswetenschappen een rol spelen of gespeeld hebben.

### 2. methodology: an introduction
Science seen as reliable way to gain knowledge.
**What makes science reliable?** = [[Scientific method]]

Main question: When are we justified in believing a scientific theory?

**Logic** (study of reasoning)
**Epistemology** (study of knowledge)

- **Context of discovery** (Contains everything relevant to the origin and conception of a scientific theory)
- **Context of justification** (Contains everything relevant to judging, as objectively as possible, whether or not a theory is believable)
Aim of methodology: to tell us how scientists should act
- which ways of scientific reasoning are correct
- know about the norms of science

Contradiction (always incorrect)
Tautologie (always correct, but never informative) (wiskunde is ook tautologisch)

When is scientific theory a good theory?
- a theory should not contradict itself.
- the better a theory is at telling us how our world is different from other worlds, the more [[empirical content]] that theory possesses.
- 

Two basic questions of empiricism:
1. Which statements can we test directly (question of the [[empirical basis]])
2. How do we get from such statements to statements that cannot be tested directly? (question of the [[confirmation]])
Only by answering both questions can we arrive at a coherent story of how we get from observation to theory.

[[theory-ladenness of observations]]

Logic is the study of: [[argumentation]]

any argument with the following form is valid:
- Everything that has property X, also has property Y .
- a does not have property Y .
------
- a does not have property X.

**[[Deductive]] and [[inductive]] arguments**
[[Deductive]] = show that if the premises are true, than the conclusion
must be true as well. when the [[conclusion]] necessarily follows from the [[premises]], if the [[premises]] are true, than it must be the case that the [[conclusion]] is also true.

[[inductive]] = shows that if the premises
are true, the conclusion is likely to be true { as long as no counterarguments
could be brought forward. is argument that is not [[deductive]] but where the [[premises]] do to some degree support the [[conclusion]]. (can have [[premises]] true but lead to false [[conclusion]])

observations turn out to be theory-dependent. That makes it difficult to hold that they form a complete objective basis that will always lead to consensus.
