Every science starts in a pre- paradigmatic phase

Here the [[paradigm]]s are formed to establish the basics backgrounds for scientists.

First scientists did not have any basic theories, individual scientists because they have no idea of the paradigms. the scientist do a lot of very different things. Different background assumptions, different ideas of what is worth to investigate

Scientist in this phase don't have a shared vocabulary, they don't know if they are talking about the same thing. Very difficult to work together, only time when communicating is to debate if their findings are correct.

This is not a very productive phase.

Very good for scientific phases one series of theories of methods become dominant, when scientists fall in line to a shared idea. This is when a [[paradigm]] is created and we go to the next phase [[Normal Science]].
