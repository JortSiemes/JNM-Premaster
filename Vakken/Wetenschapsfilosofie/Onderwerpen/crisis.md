Phase by [[Thomas Kuhn]]

Scientists become critical of the [[paradigm]], they become interested in radical new ideas and new concepts.
Scientists start to think of concepts out of the box and the longer a crisis last the more scientists become critical. The more radical new ideas that scientists take seriously.

### How to solve crisis phase:
1. [[Anomaly]] gets solved and we return to the [[Normal science]] phase.
2. New [[paradigm]] emerges, new sets of methods is introduced. If majority of scientific community embraces this new [[paradigm]] and abandons the old [[paradigm]]. We enter a [[Scientific Revolution]].
