[[Thomas Kuhn]]: "[[Paradigma]] Shift"

These are moments that define scientific disiplines.

These revolutions are the most noticable moments, because of this people think that science is always having revolutions. Kuhn says this is the exception.

When normal scientists get stuck that is when a revolution happens

This is very rare.



Examples:
Renaissance
darwinnian revolution
chomsky revolution 


By [[Thomas Kuhn]]
