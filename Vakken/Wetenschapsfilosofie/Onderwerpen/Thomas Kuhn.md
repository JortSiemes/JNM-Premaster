"Science is critical is mostly an illustion"

Science isn't very critical
Only at exceptional moments in history science is critical

Thomas Kuhn phases of science:
- [[pre-paradigmatic phase]]
- [[normal science]]
- [[crisis]]
- [[scientific revolution]]

Every science starts in a pre- paradigmatic phase
then to a [[normal science]], and will never return to previous phase

[[Normal science]], can move to [[crisis]]
[[crisis]] can return to [[scientific revolution]] or normal
[[scientific revolution]] can only go to normal

Kuhns key insights: scientists critical on new ideas and insights
every scientific discipline has a huge number of theories ideas, measuring instruments (all scientists take this for granted.)

Voorbeeld:
Biologists take cells for granted 
Take microscope take for granted that it is a good instrument
