"Science is critical is mostly an illusion"

Science isn't very critical
Only at exceptional moments in history science is critical

The pattern that Thomas discovered in all the sciences
Thomas Kuhn phases of science:
- [[pre-paradigmatic phase]]
- [[Normal science]]
- [[Crisis]]
- [[scientific revolution]]

Every science starts in a pre- paradigmatic phase
then to a [[Normal science]], and will never return to previous phase

[[Normal science]], can move to [[Crisis]]
[[Crisis]] can return to [[scientific revolution]] or normal
[[scientific revolution]] can only go to normal

Kuhns key insights: scientists critical on new ideas and insights
every scientific discipline has a huge number of theories ideas, measuring instruments (all scientists take this for granted.)

Voorbeeld:
Biologists take cells for granted 
Take microscope take for granted that it is a good instrument

### [[Paradigma]] is idea by Thomas
### [[Incommensurability]] is idea by Thomas Kuhn

Scientific progress

Normal idea of science is that when time goes on science grows and progresses.
Kuhn says that if you accept ideas of [[Paradigma]] that this picture gets totally shifted.
