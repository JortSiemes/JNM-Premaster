all the theories, concepts, methods, and so on, that a scientific discipline takes for granted and that direct research in the discipline.

Consists of things that scientists take for granted. 
By [[Thomas Kuhn]]


This is a good thing, because if you have to question basics of disciplines all the time you would get no work done.
Take large background for granted = so much you dont have to think about that you can focus on things in front of you.

But this makes scientist not critical, kuhn thinks this is good
