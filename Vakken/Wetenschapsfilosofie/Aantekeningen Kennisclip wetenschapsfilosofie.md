**What is an argument?**
terminologie:
Argument consists of 2 parts:
- [[Premises]], what we presuppose
- [[Conclusion]], what we conclude from the premises


VALID Argument:
Premises: No medieval king had absolute power over his subjects.
Premises: Louis VII of France was a mediaval king.
Conclusion: So, Louis VII of France did not have absolute power over his subjects

INVALID Argument:





[[Deductive argument]]:
An argument in which the truth of the premises absolutely guarantees the truth of the conclusion

Inductive argument:
An argument where the truth of the premises gives good reason to believe the conclusion, but does not absolutely guarantee the truth of the conclusion.


No A is B
C is A
So C is not B
