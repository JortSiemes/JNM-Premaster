#### Opdracht week 2:
Jonathan Lear, *Aristotle: The Desire to Understand*

[[Aristotle]]: "existent things can be divided into those which exist by nature and those which exist from other causes"
2 types of existence:
- Nature
- Other causes

"We do not understand something until we know why it is what it is."
Important point is that [[Aristotle]] thinks that  to say that something exists 'by nature' is to cite its cause.

Simple bodies: Earth, Air, Fire, Water
