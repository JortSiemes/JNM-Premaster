1.1
**What is an argument?**
terminologie:
Argument consists of 2 parts:
- [[Premises]], what we presuppose
- [[Conclusion]], what we conclude from the [[Premises]]


VALID Argument:
[[Premises]]: No medieval king had absolute power over his subjects.
[[Premises]]: Louis VII of France was a mediaval king.
[[Conclusion]]: So, Louis VII of France did not have absolute power over his subjects

INVALID Argument:
[[Premises]]: No medieval king had absolute power over his subjects.
[[Premises]]: Louis VII of France had a horse.
[[Conclusion]]: So, Louis VII of France did not have absolute power over his subjects

[[Deductive argument]]:
An valid argument in which the truth of the [[Premises]] absolutely guarantees the truth of the [[Conclusion]]. Impossible for [[Premises]] to be true where [[Conclusion]] is false

[[Inductive argument]]:
An argument where the truth of the [[Premises]] gives good reason to believe the [[Conclusion]], but does not absolutely guarantee the truth of the [[Conclusion]]. Possible for [[Premises]] to be true where [[Conclusion]] is false.


No A is B
C is A
So C is not B

1.2

Example [[Inductive argument]]:
[[Premises]]: I put 25 frogs in the freezer for a week, and all of them died.
[[Conclusion]]: So, all frogs die when they are put in the freezer for a week.

Inductive always needs background theory, to know if it is correct.

[[Representative Data]]:
Data that represent the subject matter as a whole, and not just a special part of it.

1.3

[[Confirmation Bias]]:
The tendency to collect and take seriously evidence that supports our beliefs, and to disregard or ignore evidence that confilcts with our beliefs.

[[Correlation]] and [[Causation]]
[[Correlation]]: the tendency of two things to occur together
[[Causation]]: the relation between causes and effects

[[Correlation]] does not imply [[Causation]].


Probabilities

1.4

**[[Karl Popper]],** 20th century
Scientist are always trying to show their theories are false.
Real scientist keeps trying to falsify his own theory.

Scienties don't accept any theories at all

Stop claiming that scientists use [[inductive argument]], and accept they only use [[deductive argument]].

Example [[Inductive argument]]:
[[Premises]]: I put 25 frogs in the freezer for a week, and all of them died.
[[Conclusion]]: So, all frogs die when they are put in the freezer for a week.

Scientists don't draw general conclusions, they are not interested in claiming a theory is true.
According to Popper, scientist never claim that theory is true/probable/likely

Critically testing theories and showing they are false.

Observation that shows that a theory is false: [[Falsificatie]]
Falsified: state of a theory that has been shown to be false.
Falsificationism: Popper's claim that scientists are only interested in [[Falsificatie]]
