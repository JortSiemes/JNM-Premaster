abstract = {ABSTRACT Transparency has become a central norm in journalism and it is deemed to increase audiences’ perceptions of credibility, legitimacy and trust in the news media. While a number of studies have sought to support these claims by primarily testing the effects of transparency on credibility perceptions, this research explores how audiences’ trust in journalism is impacted by various features and types of transparency on the news item level. Two experiments were conducted. The findings of the first experiment suggest that transparency in its current form may not increase news consumers’ trust. The second experiment explored possible explanations for the findings of the first study. The results of the second experiment indicate that while audiences value transparency in reporting, they struggle to recognize and recall the presence of transparency and transparency features within a news online article. Overall, the findings of the two studies suggest first, the need to reconceptualize how audiences perceive and process transparency information and second, to include transparency information as part of the news story.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT News organizations have turned to news automation to innovate specific processes in the newsroom. Despite the many advantages for news organizations in producing innovative news content, the news automation process is opaque and often not easily accessible for news consumers – undermining the core journalistic ethic of transparency. In this case study we examine how institutional dynamics shape internal and external algorithmic transparency practices at The Washington Post. Our findings, based on 16 expert interviews, reveal that while engineering teams at The Post exert great efforts to make some algorithmic systems transparent and explain their functions to the public (external), less information is being shared inside the newsroom (internal). This lack of internal algorithmic transparency is a potential pitfall as it could lead to mistakes in the news production and the reporting process in general.},

It uses a representative survey of Swedes, and the results show that there are three distinct forms of transparency, including the previously unreported ambient transparency, and that they appeal to different people. News consumption or social media use has little or no effect on transparency. The strongest positive effect on transparency comes from appreciation of the current quality of journalistic performance, high trust in journalists and media, and having news media and authorities as the preferred channels of information. Those most skeptical about journalism are also least positive about transparency. The results suggest that transparency has very limited reach as a cure for declining trust in, and the trustworthiness of, journalism, possibly since the acts of transparency themselves remain non-transparent.},

The study follows the recent addition of transparency to the ethics codes of two leading U.S. professional journalism associations: Society of Professional Journalists and Radio Television Digital News Association. The study includes a broad sampling of journalists working for both legacy and online media outlets, and explores the relationship between how journalists perceive transparency has been managed and the extent to which journalists practice transparency in their work. Results indicate journalists perceive transparency has not been a management priority, and how transparency is managed has a significant effect on the extent it is practiced. These results are consistent across media types, coverage areas, demographics and extent of professional experience. The data provide evidence that if the potential of transparency as a digital-age journalistic tool is to be realized, news managers must take a more active role in its development as professional knowledge, a newsroom norm and set of practices.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Editorial statutes are standardizing documents that organize and structure the media. They are a legal provision allowing them to define their ethical principles and conduct, establish their identity and ideology, and create a communication pact with their audiences. Editorial statutes can thus be considered mechanisms of media responsibility, accountability, and transparency. In Portugal, such statutes are legally required and are often perceived as formal, general, and bland documents. This paper presents a study of sixteen editorial statutes of the Portuguese press, designed to understand the issues and values of these documents. Thirty-eight categories were identified across three key dimensions: self-definition, normative values, and ideological elements. While these dimensions seek to address the requirements set out in the Portuguese Media Law, this analysis defies the common concepts of superficiality and homogeneity of editorial statutes.},

abstract = {Transparency is increasingly touted as a strategic tool for elevating journalistic authority. Despite this push, literature has overlooked how transparency can be utilized for authority purposes in audiovisual artefacts. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative thematic analysis of The New York Times’ podcast Caliphate to examine how transparency is strategically weaponized to stake a claim to journalistic authority. Based on the premise that transparency is a metajournalistic performance – a type of journalism about journalism that is performative in acting on people’s perception of journalistic authority – we identify three of those metajournalistic performances in the podcast: Revealing the journalistic process, Constructing the reporter’s persona and Reaffirming the journalistic culture. Together, they exhibit a form of self-celebratory transparency that strategically performs boundary-setting, definitional control and legitimization functions, in a bid to impress audiences and have them recognize the journalistic authority of the Caliphate reporters and The Times. We conclude with the implications of these strategic performances of transparency. First, how it can be used by reporters to reinstate verticality over audiences. Second, how the journalistic culture (norms, values, practices, etc.) can be transparently projected outward (to the public) or inward (to the journalist themself) to elevate authority – a new concept for journalism studies. Third, how metajournalistic performances of transparency may reveal power dynamics within the journalistic field.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Media trust is at near-record lows, arguably lowering news consumption, threatening the viability of journalism, and increasing citizen polarization. In examining the causes of low media trust, researchers often look at intrinsic audience factors rather than audience perceptions of journalism—in particular, documenting media trust's strong inverse correlation with conservatism, but seldom investigating trust's relationship with perceptions of journalistic quality. The quality connection is worth investigating because studies have found that journalistic errors are common, and such inaccuracies are also widely perceived. This study asked which has a stronger impact on media trust, audience ideologies or perceived journalistic errors. Using a survey of 1026 U.S. adults, the study found an inverse relationship between error perceptions and trust levels. The most frequently perceived errors were sensationalized or understated stories and stories missing essential information. Three types of errors and both social and economic conservatism were found to have statistically significant, negative relationships with trust, while a fourth error type—misspellings—had a positive relationship. The two ideological factors had a slightly stronger media trust impact than the collective error types. Nonetheless, perception of errors accounted for significant variation in trust levels. These results bolster the imperative for rigorous reporting and editing.},

How can we utilize transparency to promote trust in news? We examine this question through a qualitative lens by interviewing journalists and news consumers---the two stakeholders in a news system. We designed a scenario to demonstrate transparency features using two fundamental news attributes that convey the trustworthiness of a news article: source and message. In the interviews, our news consumers expressed the idea that news transparency could be best shown by providing indicators of objectivity in two areas (news selection and framing) and by providing indicators of evidence in four areas (presence of source materials, anonymous sourcing, verification, and corrections upon erroneous reporting). While our journalists agreed with news consumers' suggestions of using evidence indicators, they also suggested additional transparency indicators in areas such as the news reporting process and personal/organizational conflicts of interest. Prompted by our scenario, participants offered new design considerations for building trustworthy news platforms, such as designing for easy comprehension, presenting appropriate details in news articles (e.g., showing the number and nature of corrections made to an article), and comparing attributes across news organizations to highlight diverging practices. Comparing the responses from our two stakeholder groups reveals conflicting suggestions with trade-offs between them. Our study has implications for HCI designers in building trustworthy news systems.},

However, the scholarly literature has focused primarily on normative considerations, without providing much empirical data that could confirm what are widely assumed to be the positive effects of transparency. In this paper, I argue, first, that editorial texts, in their various manifestations, are the most potent of the various established means of displaying transparency for opening up the production of news item. However, I then draw on my linguistic, process-focused research on quoting and highlight challenges this process creates for the use of editorial texts in the pursuit of transparency. It turns out that conveying the essentials of decision-making that occurs during newswriting requires profound understanding and awareness of the interplay between modalities, co-texts and contexts of language use. Finally, implementing the norm of transparency has allegedly led to the transformation of a well-intentioned goal into an institutional myth, leading journalists – constrained, for example, by the mechanism of impression management – to disclose only socially acceptable practices. Therefore, I conclude by arguing for transdisciplinary research in which scholars research ‘on, for and with’ (Perrin, 2018) other stakeholders in order to bring about a fundamental change in the culture of transparency in journalism.},

abstract = {The introduction of digital communication technologies has resulted in the emergence of transparency as a journalistic norm. Often termed the “new objectivity,” transparency has been viewed as central to restoring trust in journalism. Not surprisingly, news organizations have claimed they have introduced transparency measures that enable audiences to look behind the curtain of news production. We, however, argue that such efforts primarily involve technological features that are institutionally mandated with little involvement from journalists. That is, transparency in journalism has been digitally outsourced to technology, a development that disconnects journalists from considering and implementing transparency in their work.},

abstract = {The growing use of difficult-to-parse algorithmic systems in the production of news, from algorithmic curation to automated writing and news bots, problematizes the normative turn toward transparency as a key tenet of journalism ethics. Pragmatic guidelines that facilitate algorithmic transparency are needed. This research presents a focus group study that engaged 50 participants across the news media and academia to discuss case studies of algorithms in news production and elucidate factors that are amenable to disclosure. Results indicate numerous opportunities to disclose information about an algorithmic system across layers such as the data, model, inference, and interface. Findings underscore the deeply entwined roles of human actors in such systems as well as challenges to adoption of algorithmic transparency including the dearth of incentives for organizations and the concern for overwhelming end-users with a surfeit of transparency information.},

Interviews with 17 journalists from leading German news organizations indicate that although certain forms of openness have been conceptually adopted, transparency is far from being embraced as an innovation nor institutionally implemented, indicating that the adoption of an innovation such as transparency remains contingent on national contextual factors.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT As the news media continue to search for sustainable business models in response to digitisation, concern about low levels of trust in news has been rising. Trust in news brands is seen as an essential pre-requisite for their economic survival. While there is extant research on the crisis of trust in news, less attention has been paid to identifying possible solutions from the perspective of the audience. Based on a survey of 1619 Australian news consumers, this paper helps address this gap. Informed by existing research, participants were asked about a range of possible factors influencing their perceptions of trust in news. Participants expressed strongest support for reducing bias and opinion from journalists in stories, making reporters declare all conflicts of interest, and boosting the amount of in-depth reporting. Increasing journalists’ activity on social media and employing more reporters, were less supported remedies, particularly among those who tend to have low trust in news. Those who have higher trust in news are more supportive of options to boost their trust further, whereas those with low trust innews are less enthusiastic. These findings highlight the challenge for news organisations of improving perceptions of trust among those who are already sceptical about the news.},

The practice has re-emerged in the 21st century, in social media and particularly as demonstrated by the new website The Players’ Tribune. Its popularity encourages ethical discussion about ghostwriting’s conflation of journalism and public relations, and the ethical debate it incites. Particular attention centers on the core journalism value of transparency, as it relates to both professions. The article posits that the blurring of professional boundaries between public relations and journalism can have detrimental effects to the credibility of both fields. The authors call for greater transparency in the use of ghostwriting, particularly when used in a sports journalism setting.},

The stimuli contained information boxes designed to indicate that the story was not written in a traditional journalistic style (message cues) and missing background information on the author (source cues). Results show significant effects of the cues on credibility assessment and cognitive absorption.},

This study analyzes 30 of what it terms “major mea culpa” statements to explore how media organizations talk about their significant professional errors and the tools they use to maintain their journalistic identities when such errors occur. Using content analysis to explore the major themes of journalistic process and journalistic principle, this study concludes that the discursive techniques central to “major mea culpas” seek to assert and affirm journalistic identity when actions may suggest that an organization no longer reflects the ideals of the profession.},

The results reveal an almost total absence of any transparency effect on either source or message credibility, although some small significant effects could be observed primarily regarding internal hyperlinks, comments and contextual information. Although further research is needed in this area, the study suggests that transparency does not affect the credibility of journalism in the eyes of the contemporary audience and thus has limited appeal as a new norm in journalism.},

In Brazil and the United States, two pieces of information in a Knowledge Panel provided the strongest heuristics that a news outlet was trustworthy: a description of the news outlet and a description of other sites accessed by people who frequent that news outlet’s website. In Germany, information about journalists and the description of the news outlet were the strongest cues. Results offer insights into how people heuristically process online news and are discussed in relation to the heuristic-systematic model of information processing.},

Three experiments (Study 1: n  =  753; Study 2: n  =  599; Study 3: n  =  321) tested whether adding a transparency box to news stories that explained why and how journalists covered each story would improve credibility perceptions. Study 1 used a mock news site, and the box did not increase credibility perceptions. Study 2 made the box more prominent and used the real audiences of two news sites, USA TODAY and the Tennessean, and the box increased credibility perceptions. Study 3 used a less prominent box on the real audiences of three McClatchy newspapers, and the box did not increase credibility perceptions regardless of where it was placed on the news story. Results suggest transparency boxes may have limited influence on news outlet credibility, but they must be very prominent to have an effect and do not work consistently.},

abstract = {Trust in journalism is highly relevant for society. Within the past years, especially during the COVID19-pandemic, trust in journalism became a recurring subject of public debate in Germany: Journalism is often vilified as ‘lying press’ and the legitimacy of traditional media is increasingly questioned. While in Germany, unlike other countries, we do not see a crisis in media trust, there nonetheless is a certain share of the population being skeptical towards traditional journalism. News outlets therefore need to ask themselves how to win back these sections of their audience and strengthen trust in their work. So far, research on media trust has largely focused on the audience – the journalistic perspective has hardly been examined. By conducting 29 interviews with German journalists, this paper aims to analyze which strategies news outlets pursue to cultivate trust in their work. Three main approaches to trust-building can be identified: The quality oriented, the audience engagers and the transparent. The results enable us to get a clearer overview on how news outlets try to regain and build their audience’s trust – which presents starting points for both journalism practice and research.},
