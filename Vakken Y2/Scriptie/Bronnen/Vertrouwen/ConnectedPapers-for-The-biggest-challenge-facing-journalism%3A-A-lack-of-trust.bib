abstract = {The single biggest challenge facing journalism today is the public’s lack of trust in it. This is not a new challenge, but it is persistent, and it has been getting worse. Gallup’s most recent poll on trust in US media found only 28 percent of respondents believed news organizations supported democracy ‘very well’ or ‘well’. By contrast, 43 percent of respondents believed news media supported democracy ‘poorly’ or ‘very poorly’ (Ritter and Jones, 2018). Public trust in news media has waned for many reasons. The collapse of traditional, advertising-dominated business models have left news organizations as a whole with fewer resources to produce quality journalism (Rosenstiel and Mitchell, 2004). Audiences have reacted negatively to sensationalized coverage and ‘clickbait’ as news organizations try to entice people to click on stories online (Brants, 2013). A lack of trust in media has also been connected to declining trust in government and other institutions (Jones, 2004). Media are seen as being controlled by powerful people who want to push their personal agendas rather than serve the public (Newman and Fletcher, 2017). Individual journalists are also seen as powerful people who push agendas that are not always in the public interest. This was clear in the recent book Becoming the News (Palmer, 2017), which focused on the experiences of ordinary people who became news subjects. The book noted a disconnect between the way ordinary people see journalists and the way journalists see themselves. The news subjects ‘felt like David, to journalism’s Goliath’, in their interactions with journalists. News subjects often felt like they were used by journalists to tell stories whose direction was out of their control. In journalists’ minds, though, ‘They are David, facing down the powers-that-be in the name of the citizens’ (p. 7). This disconnect reveals another reason for a lack of trust in media: journalists often do not recognize the power they wield over members of the public, and thus fail to treat them with sufficient care and respect. Having the trust of one’s audience is vital to journalism’s core function of ‘sensemaking’ (Kovach and Rosenstiel, 2014). Audiences depend upon journalists to help them make sense of current events by explaining them in context, such as by providing a},

abstract = {Media research demonstrates that audience trust in the news media is a highly consequential factor, shaping audience selection of and response to media, and potentially impacting citizens’ perceptions of the political system at large. Still, our knowledge about the correlates of trust in media is limited. Only a few studies have utilized a correlational design to explore the associations between trust in media and other factors, and almost all of these studies originate in the U.S. context. The current investigation utilizes data from 44 diverse countries (n = 57,847), collected as part of the World Values Survey, to broaden our understanding of trust in media. The aim is two-fold—to learn about individual-level correlates across contexts and to demonstrate that macro-level factors play a part in shaping such trust. Our findings indicate that levels of political interest, interpersonal trust, and exposure to television news and newspapers are positively correlated with trust in media, while education and exposure to news on the Internet are negatively associated. On the macro level, postmaterialism emerged as a consistent predictor of trust in media. State ownership of the media industry did not have a main effect on trust in media after controlling for other factors. However, an interaction was found between state ownership and level of democracy: state ownership of television is positively associated with media trust in democratic societies and negatively associated with trust in media in nondemocratic societies.},

abstract = {Recent developments in journalism seemingly curtail a satisfying work environment and contribute to journalists experiencing discrepancies between initial job expectations and actual day-to-day practices. This can lead to disillusionment, challenging journalists’ dedication to their job. Research indicates that young journalists are particularly affected by the symptoms of the journalistic crisis and thus exhibit low job commitment. This study examines the extent to which their initial job motivations and expectations are met or disappointed in practice. We apply Bourdieu’s concept of illusio to advance our understanding of expectations and experiences in the journalistic field and as an explanation for why journalists tend to remain in the profession. Based on in-depth interviews with 40 Austrian journalists we found that autonomy constitutes a key facet of the field’s illusio, both as an ideal of journalistic work, as well as the superior reason to become a journalist despite the awareness of financial drawbacks. While respondents are disillusioned by the lack of autonomous decision-making in everyday work, they still adhere to the ideal of acting as autonomous providers of information and thus remain in the profession. Crucially, they believe that accepting periods of precarity, as well as less autonomous work empowers them to better contribute to journalism’s societal mission.},

The findings show that constructive and solutions journalism are defined similarly: they profess traditional Anglo-Saxon journalistic norms and practices, even as they shift focus from problems to solutions. The metajournalistic discourse indicates a tension over the normative roles of journalism. Constructive journalism justifies its existence by the intensified need to solve vexing social issues. At the same time, proponents of constructive journalism regularly distance themselves from advocating for social good and claim to objectively cover solutions without endorsing them. This strategic rhetoric signals an attempt to draw a sharp line between constructive journalism and advocacy, and to situate constructive journalism within the boundaries of a traditional monitorial role of journalism. Metadiscourse about constructive journalism reveals reluctance to acknowledge and articulate its normative constructive role that seeks to help society.},

abstract = {Western democracies face a major crisis undermining the public good that is mainstream journalism. Primarily, we are bearing witness to a rejection of public discourse that nurtures democracies and connects multiple publics toward shared work on common problems such as violence in schools or opiate addiction. Functionally, this is a result of declining institutional trusting relationships that have been documented across all social and political institutions from the schools to the church as well as across the globe.1 This essay explores this challenge to mainstream news organizations as one of a crisis of our publics, its manifesting symptoms as well as it causes, and a few of the responses to fix the situation. It is my argument that today’s journalists might distance from their synergetic relationships with institutionalized power elites and turn toward communities, helping to bridge between the poles of discourse and link together disparate conversations to enable citizens toward solutions. The decline in media trust – less than a third of US citizens report confidence in news organizations – has been happening for decades and is merely a symptom of the much bigger problem: the worshipping of the individual at the expense of community. We are no longer in any ‘public conversation’ (Benhabib, 1996), but a giant messaging system that thrives on connective algorithms and emotions (both positive and negative) that help individuals feel (Papacharissi, 2014). Our ‘publics’ today are really niche-oriented groups susceptible to commercial and political manipulations that encourage people to assume binary interests and pick sides to protect discursive territory. Once sides have been picked, attacks to deflate and malign the other ‘side’ are the order of the day. Anything goes in this chaos of the so-called ‘post-public’ reality – from fake news to lying – so long as ‘my’ taxes are cut or they ‘stick it to the other guy’ to ease the festering},

abstract = {J ournalism has increasingly become digital, and this is bringing both unprecedented opportunities and challenges to the business. One of the profound shifts lies in the connection between news producers and their audiences, and consequently the changing roles of newsmakers and news consumers. The Internet is making information access much easier, and correspondingly it is a great deal more difficult for newsmakers to retain audiences. This means that the battle for attention among competing news outlets is driving journalists and editors to capture as much knowledge as they can about their audience – from their demographics to news consumption patterns, in real time – to optimise both content and the presentation of content, and thereby to survive. Again, it is technology that makes it possible to track audience data in a systematic way in real-time, using web analytics, or audience metrics, which is defined by the Reuters Institute (Cherubini & Nielsen, 2016) as ‘systematic analysis of quantitative data on various aspects of audience behaviour aimed at growing audiences, increasing engagement, and improving newsroom workflows’. The vast majority of news organisations are already monitoring audience metrics, such as clicks, engaged time, shares to Facebook or Twitter, and blending the results into editorial decisions, from story selection and story placement, to headline writing. As Anderson (2011) has noticed, editorial decisions are increasingly dependent on audience metrics as ‘a supplement to news judgment’.},

abstract = {Most people in most countries have a distrust – even a loathing, it would seem – of the news media.1 They find the news biased and belittling, dull and depressing, overly negative and overly complicated. But why exactly do people hate the press? Why does journalism generate such animus? Describing the state of affairs in the United States, the veteran journalist James Fallows noted, ‘Americans have never been truly fond of their press. Through the last decade, however, their disdain for the media establishment has reached new levels. Americans believe that the news media have become too arrogant, cynical, scandal-minded, and destructive’. That passage, however, did not come from The Atlantic amid the hyper-polarized 2016 election season, nor after the first 500 days of President Donald J. Trump’s administration in mid-2018 – it came from Fallows’ writing in 1996, a full 4 years before this journal, now celebrating its 20th anniversary, was launched. Let that sink in a moment. It provides both a healthy dose of perspective and a sobering note of caution. On the one hand, there is a much longer history around problems of press performance and public confidence in the news media; on the other hand, and especially in the US context but certainly relevant elsewhere as well, Fallows’ (1996) assessment makes contemporary conditions all the more disconcerting: If things were so demonstrably bad then, how truly horrible must they be now? In this essay, I will argue that this broad distrust of journalism, while neither new nor as historically exceptional as people sometimes believe, matters at this moment because of what it signals about the institutional weakness of the press, particularly at a time when journalism’s normative functions for society are needed amid a global uptick in authoritarian tendencies. It matters, therefore, to consider how it got to be this way and what might be done about it.},

This study examines content analysis data for nearly 5,000 applications to the Knight News Challenge, exploring the distinguishing features of its applicants, finalists, and winners. This analysis is presented against the backdrop of a key conceptual question for journalism in the 21st century: how does it reconcile the growing tension between professional control and open participation? Results suggest that finalists and winners more often use forms of participation and distributed knowledge (i.e., crowdsourcing and user manipulation) and other features not typically associated with journalism (e.g., software development). These findings are placed in the context of the Knight Foundation’s broader efforts to shape journalism innovation.},

Constructive journalism draws on behavioural sciences, specifically positive psychology. From this, it is assumed that including constructive elements such as solution orientation, future orientation, depolarising techniques and seeking co-creation with the public contribute to the well-being of individuals as well as society. Following a public-oriented perspective, audience research is performed to understand how people value the incorporation of constructive elements in the news. Using an online survey, data were gathered from 3263 people in the Netherlands, aged 20–65. Results show an overall positive valuation, with some constructive elements appreciated more than others. Age, educational background and news interest seem to play a role in the nature of this valuation. Constructive journalism is steadily finding its way into journalism practice. There are also indications that people value news that incorporates constructive elements. It is important to further develop and define the concept in the coming years.},

Some journalists have attempted to address this issue through a style of news labeled solutions journalism. This experiment tests the effects of this increasingly popular approach. Results revealed that discussing an effective solution to a social problem in a news story caused readers to feel less negative and to report more favorable attitudes toward the news article and toward solutions to the problem than when no solution or an ineffective solution was mentioned. Reading about an effective solution did not, however, impact on readers’ behavioral intentions or actual behaviors.

Therefore, we set out to explore, advance, and shape a research agenda, and to build a theoretical and empirical foundation for constructive journalism, providing a 360° view by bringing together an international body of scholarship approaching the topic and the issues raised through different disciplinary, conceptual, and methodological lenses. As such, we aim, first, to contribute to the conceptual development of constructive journalism by refining its roots in positive psychology and carefully delineating its position along related and divergent types of journalism, identifying its core values and principles, the lineages and digressions. Second, we seek to advance theory building in this nascent research domain based on empirical data and insights variously derived from quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches exploring, describing, and testing through large-scale or in-depth analyses, how constructive journalism can be interpreted and put in practice, how it materializes and with what effect. In doing so, we adopt an overall stance of ‘critical appreciation’ toward the subject, engaging in foundational thinking while not shying away from an assessment of the potential and effective critique or controversy stirred by this proliferating ‘alternative’ branch of journalism.},

Using the responses of Israeli adults (n = 405) to an online survey, this study explored various predictors of public trust in journalists and found that perceived correspondence between direct personal experience and news reports was the strongest predictor of trust in journalists and the only one that remained significant when controlling for all other factors. In addition, general levels of public trust in journalists were found to be in small decline. These findings suggest that declining levels of trust in journalists may be associated with actual evaluations of the quality of media performance by individuals, thus refocusing the question of trust on journalistic practice rather than on audience attributes. At the same time, the fact that personal and possibly anecdotal evidence may have significant long-term effects on audience levels of trust is potentially problematic from a democratic standpoint. We discuss the implications and limitations of our findings.},

abstract = {Despite signs of declining press trust in many western countries, we know little about trends in press trust across the world. Based on comparative survey data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and European Values Study (EVS), this study looks into national levels of trust in the press and identifies factors that drive differences across societies and individuals as well as over time. Findings indicate that the widely noted decline in media trust is not a universal trend; it is true for only about half of the studied countries, with the United States experiencing the largest and most dramatic drop in trust in the press. Political trust has emerged as key factor for our understanding of trust in the press. We found robust evidence for what we called the trust nexus—the idea that trust in the news media is strongly linked to the way publics look at political institutions. The link between press trust and political trust was considerably stronger in politically polarized societies. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the relation between press trust and political trust is becoming stronger over time. We reason that the strong connection between media and political trust may be driven by a growing public sentiment against elite groups.},

abstract = {This article argues that trust in journalism is a critical mechanism in social cohesion. However, trust research in journalism has a critical flaw, since trust is measured as news consumption, while journalists’ roles are considered via questions of authority. However, scholars have thought about trust in limited ways that have failed to address the relational nature of trust that includes journalists, audiences, sources, and other social actors such “objects of journalism.” The material turn in journalism is invoked as a way to move beyond this dichotomy. Via hard and soft objects of journalism, discussed here as news buildings, “raw materials” of journalism, and digital news products like software inspire new ways of thinking about trust.},

The approach has a growing appeal in the professional world, but what little exists in academic research fails to offer thorough theoretical and conceptual definitions or a concrete operationalization of the practice. Through in-depth interviews, journalists familiar with solutions journalism offered insights about how to define and measure the practice. Specifically, journalists said solution-oriented news stories contribute to more accurate and balanced news coverage, they are sophisticated and rigorous, and they intend to motivate readers to contribute to societal change. Further findings help distinguish the Solutions Journalism Network’s conceptualization of the concept from how working journalists practice it, particularly in regard to the extent that solutions journalism overlaps with advocacy journalism. Finally, this study offers guidelines for measuring a solutions news story in an effort to spur consistent future research on the effects of the solutions journalism approach.},

Previous research had suggested that alternative news use is correlated with lower levels of trust in news, whereas mainstream news use is correlated with higher levels of trust in news. Our research, based on a survey of news users in 35 countries, shows that using either mainstream or alternative news sources is associated with higher levels of trust in news. However, we find that using social media as a main source of news is correlated with lower levels of trust in news. When looking at country effects, we find that systemic factors such as the levels of press freedom or the audience share of the public service broadcaster in a country are not significantly correlated with trust in news.},

abstract = {Constructive journalism has become a popular term in recent years, and has been the basis of a number of seminars, conferences, courses at journalism schools, fellowship programs, and research projects. This article traces the origins of constructive journalism by describing and discussing the proponents, precedents, and principles of the movement. The article shows that constructive journalism is no new term and that its inherent principles share similarities with other well-known movements in the history of journalism. These include action journalism that was popular on both sides of the Atlantic at the turn of last century and public journalism that flourished at the turn of this century. Common for most of these movement are, however, their lack of conceptual clarity. The differences and similarities between constructive journalism, past movements, and more classical conceptions of journalism are analyzed through the framework of the Journalistic Compass that delineates four classical roles within journalism. The article concludes by describing the opportunities–and difficulties – that this recent movement faces as still more persons and organizations lay claim to practicing constructive journalism and it discusses how the proponents might learn from former movements that have gained popularity for a period but whose importance has since diminished.},

Students have a proposal and final thesis examination where they present and explain the research that they have conducted. The researcher interested to provide views and further investigating the meaning of appearance which is expected to obtain a detailed picture of the meaning of non-verbal sign constructed on the meaning of the appearance by semiotic analysis. For this reason, this study aims at 1) To describe the kinds of non-verbal communications used by the student of English Department in the proposal seminar, and 2) To describe the meanings of the non-verbal communications used by the student of English Department in the proposal seminar. The theory of three basic semiotic elements proposed by Peirce (2003) is used to identify the sign action and also determined better the nature and rhetorical function of both verbal and non-verbal representation. The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative. The data of this research are the non-verbal communication of the students from the English department through their Facial Expression, Eye Contacts , Emblems, Adaptors and Body Action. The source of the data obtained one video from the seminar proposal. A semiotic visual image of signs, in the seminar proposal video. There are 7 kinds of non-verbal communication the student showed that obtained and observed by the researcher. The result of this research shows that five types of the non-verbal communications are found in the seminar, i.e. fear, amusement, agony, surprise and disgust. The most dominant type of non-verbal communication is the state of surprise with 2 expressions.

abstract = {Abstract In January 2019, What is Peppa?, a promotional video for a Chinese New Year movie, received widespread attention in China immediately after its release. This paper explains the success of the video from the perspective of visual framing, and employs Systemic Visual Grammar to analyze how visual semiotics are applied to frame prominent topics so as to achieve promotional purposes. The results show that: (i) visual semiotics are used to frame the topic of empty nesters, implying that this issue brings negative consequences and evoking the audience’s empathy and concern; (ii) visuals frame the topic of family love, in which the main protagonist’s actions are highlighted; and (iii) the topic of family reunion is mainly framed and realized by delicate compositional arrangements. Using various visual semiotics at the denotative, stylistic-semantic, connotative, and ideological levels, this video establishes both visual and emotional communication between the main character and the audience, making the promotional purpose more successful. The results highlight and specify the important roles of visual frames in promotional videos, and the integration of Peppa with traditional Chinese culture, love, and family reunion represents a visual approach to glocalization.},

abstract = {People often form immediate expectations about other people, or groups of people, based on visual appearance and characteristics of their voice and speech. These stereotypes, often inaccurate or overgeneralized, may translate to robots that carry human-like qualities. This study aims to explore if nationality-based preconceptions regarding appearance and accents can be found in people’s perception of a virtual and a physical social robot. In an online survey with 80 subjects evaluating different first-language-influenced accents of English and nationality-influenced human-like faces for a virtual robot, we find that accents, in particular, lead to preconceptions on perceived competence and likeability that correspond to previous findings in social science research. In a physical interaction study with 74 participants, we then studied if the perception of competence and likeability is similar after interacting with a robot portraying one of four different nationality representations from the online survey. We find that preconceptions on national stereotypes that appeared in the online survey vanish or are overshadowed by factors related to general interaction quality. We do, however, find some effects of the robot’s stereotypical alignment with the subject group, with Swedish subjects (the majority group in this study) rating the Swedish-accented robot as less competent than the international group, but, on the other hand, recalling more facts from the Swedish robot’s presentation than the international group does. In an extension in which the physical robot was replaced by a virtual robot interacting in the same scenario online, we further found the same results that preconceptions are of less importance after actual interactions, hence demonstrating that the differences in the ratings of the robot between the online survey and the interaction is not due to the interaction medium. We hence conclude that attitudes towards stereotypical national representations in HRI have a weak effect, at least for the user group included in this study (primarily educated young students in an international setting).},

Building on extensive fieldwork at print and online news media outlets on the island and 14 in-depth interviews with reporters, editors, and news bloggers, this article shows that constructive journalism practices are widespread in St. Maarten. These are based on ideals of contributing to economic development, engagement and belonging, and social stability. The fieldwork, however, also revealed skepticism toward constructive journalism practices because of local political, economic, and socio-cultural constraints. This skepticism parallels broader critiques on active and involved forms of journalism, throwing up questions about the meaning and feasibility of a ‘constructive’ role of journalists in young, postcolonial democracies. This article argues that local constraints on St. Maarten journalism undermine the normative underpinnings of constructive journalism and calls for more disruptive journalism to serve the local community.},

Taking a holistic definition of constructive journalism as a basis, the two experiments discussed in this article examined the audience responses to German-language news and features presented to readers and radio listeners in both constructive and non-constructive versions. The results are multifaceted. On the micro-level, constructive forms can counteract a negative view of the world because the audience recognises a solution-orientation and underlying spirit of hope. The increased willingness to share constructive stories indicates, on the macro-level, that constructive reporting can raise the perception of possible solutions and role models and hence encourage engagement and emulation. But the hopeful prospects should not be used to simply garnish a difficult problem at any price and maintaining a distance from positive examples is advisable—otherwise, the constructive story runs the risk of being perceived as a commercial or political influence.},

Pivotal questions for journalism are: How to stay relevant for the public? How to redefine the public service function? How to deal with the increased competition? How to deal with a negative focus in the news that might offer people disillusion instead of hopeful perspectives? These questions are addressed within technological, social-cultural and economic developments that have a huge impact on the information supply. In this context, constructive journalism emerge. As a movement, it is indebted to civic journalism but takes it to the next level. Constructive journalism reconsiders the goals and values of professional journalism and cherishes a form of journalism that is public-oriented, solution-oriented, future-oriented and action-oriented, trying to avoid a bias towards negativity in the news. The break-through of the twenty-first century network model implies that journalism needs to move into a new direction, fostering cooperation, transparency and constructiveness.},
