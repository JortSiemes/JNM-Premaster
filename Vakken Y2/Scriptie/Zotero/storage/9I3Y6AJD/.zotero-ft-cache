COMPONENTS

Range slider

A range slider allows users to choose an approximate number from a range.

Component code
 Guidance
 When to use the range slider component
When the range is more important than precision. For instance, it could be more important for a target price selector to communicate where the target price falls within a certain range than the precise dollar amount selected.
When a relative value is more important than an exact value. For instance, a volume slider is typically more focussed on the relative loudness of the output rather than the specific decibel level.
 When to consider something else
Use a regular text input if a user needs to enter a precise number.
Usability guidance
Highlight the control when selected. The slider control should change color to indicate it is active when a user selects it.
The control must be draggable. Users should be able to drag the slider control or select somewhere along the slider itself to change the value.
Label the limits of the range. When appropriate, label the ends of the slider with the limits of the range (for example: “0/100”, “small/large” or “less expensive/more expensive”).
Don’t be too granular. In a range slider, the relative value is more important than the specific value, so set the step attribute so it’s not too granular. By setting the step to a value of 10-20% of the total range you prevent unnecessary precision and cognitive strain in your users. For example, set step="10" in a total range of 100.
 Accessibility guidance
Customize form controls accessibly. If you customize this component, ensure that it continues to meet the accessibility requirements that apply to all form controls.
 Using the range slider component
Set the min and max attribute of the input element to correspond to the instructions or labels that accompany the slider.
Range slider initialization properties
Property Description Default

data-text-unit

Adds a unit to screen reader callouts. The unit will be read after the current value. For example, adding a value of “stars” enables a readout like “3.5 stars of 5.”

Undefined by default

data-text-preposition

Changes the preposition between current value and max value in screen reader readouts. For example, adding a value with the Spanish translation “de” enables a readout “like 20 de 100”. When adding a range slider to a non-English page, be sure to update the preposition as necessary.
