Abstract
This paper answers the question, "Why do organizations process information?" Uncertainty and equivocality are defined as two forces that influence information processing in organizations. Organization structure and internal systems determine both the amount and richness of information provided to managers. Models are proposed that show how organizations can be designed to meet the information needs of technology, interdepartmental relations, and the environment. One implication for managers is that a major problem is lack of clarity, not lack of data. The models indicate how organizations can be designed to provide information mechanisms to both reduce uncertainty and resolve equivocality.

... In summation, our findings demonstrate how hardship live streamers use multi-modal cues during their ELS by adopting an authentic, grateful, and resilient image through a combination of hardship storytelling and production promotion. They take advantage of the richness of live streaming that helps them share more visual and verbal cues to provide and receive immediate feedback from their audience (Daft & Lengel, 1986). Compared with other E-commerce live streamers, the hardship live streamers in our study try to differentiate themselves by highlighting their unique circumstances. ...
