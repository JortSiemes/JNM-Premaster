Abstract
A series of usability tests was run on two enterprise software applications, followed by verbal administration of the System Usability Scale. The original instrument with its 5-point Likert items was presented, as well as an alternate version modified with 7-point Likert items. Participants in the 5-point scale condition were more likely than those presented with the 7-point scale to interpolate, i.e., attempt a response between two discrete values presented to them. In an applied setting, this implied that electronic radio-button style survey tools using 5-point items might not be accurately measuring participant responses. This finding supported the conclusion that 7-point Likert items provide a more accurate measure of a participant's true evaluation and are more appropriate for electronically-distributed and otherwise unsupervised usability questionnaires.

... For the collection of appropriate data concerning the research objective, it is important to target the right population (i.e., practitioners have experience of dealing with security in DevOps or working with DevSecOps). The targeted population was approached using various social media networks (Facebook and LinkedIn) and further used a snowballing technique to spread the questionnaire among the targeted community [59,60]. Secondly, we visited 11 software development organizations working with DevOps and Secure DevOps, in Finland and the United Arab Emirates. ...

... A consensus is considered achieved if all experts provide the same assessment as their previous assessment. The assessment utilizes a 7-point Likert scale, due to its better sensitivity to get a more accurate evaluation [18]. The success factors assessment were analyzed based on relative importance index (RII), standard deviation (SD), and mean score (MS) [10,19]. ...

... Experts were also asked to rate the perceived level of importance to a ball carrier's decision-making of each of the terms in the three context-based themes (match context, offensive context and defensive context) (see Figure 1) on a seven-point Likert scale (Costa 2005) (1-very unimportant, 2-unimportant, 3somewhat unimportant, 4-neither important nor unimportant, 5-somewhat important, 6-important and 7-very important). This was conducted as a seven-point Likert scale to allow respondents to choose between more clearly opposed options based on their opinions and increase the sensitivity of results between the contextual factors rather than just looking to reach a level of agreement (Finstad 2010). No options for comments were included in the section. ...

... The questionnaire was measured on a four-point scale, with one (1) denoting strong disagreement, two (2) denoting disagreements, three (3) denoting agreement, and four (4) denoting strong agreements. The fourpoint Likert scale was used in place of the more common fivepoint one because the researchers did not want participants to choose neutral or indecisive answers because such answers could not be linked to agreement or disagreement (Sullivan and Artino 2013;Bishop, Tuchfarber, and Oldendick 2010;Krosnick and Presser 2010;Finstad 2010 . Appendix S1 contains a sample of the questionnaire. ...

The Usability Metric for User Experience
September 2010 · Interacting with Computers
Kraig Finstad
The Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX) is a four-item Likert scale used for the subjective assessment of an application’s perceived usability. It is designed to provide results similar to those obtained with the 10-item System Usability Scale, and is organized around the ISO 9241–11 definition of usability. A pilot version was assembled from candidate items, which was then tested ... [Show full abstract]

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is an inexpensive, yet effective tool for assessing the usability of a product, including Web sites, cell phones, interactive voice response systems, TV applications, and more. It provides an easy-to-understand score from 0 (negative) to 100 (positive). While a 100-point scale is intuitive in many respects and allows for relative judgments, information describing ...

Critical Review of 'The Usability Metric for User Experience'
June 2013 · Interacting with Computers
James R. Lewis
In 2010, Kraig Finstad published (in this journal) ‘The Usability Metric for User Experience’—the UMUX. The UMUX is a standardized usability questionnaire designed to produce scores similar to the System Usability Scale (SUS), but with 4 rather than 10 items. The development of the questionnaire followed standard psychometric practice. Psychometric evaluation of the final version of the UMUX ... [Show full abstract]
