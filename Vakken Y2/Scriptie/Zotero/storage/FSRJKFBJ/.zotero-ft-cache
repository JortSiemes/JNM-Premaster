Abstract
Exposure to low-quality news videos on a newspaper website led a younger audience to see the news organization as less credible and lacking in value. Findings offer a cautionary tale for news organizations because even a few low-quality news videos on a newspaper website might damage newspapers' fervent effort to attract a younger audience.

... Cummins and Chambers (2011) found production choices are not merely esthetic, for something as mechanical as high resolution can be seen as more credible by an audience. Quality production matters, too, as poorly constructed videos are a turn-off for many viewers (Chen et al., 2017). ...
... This study was not an experiment, and therefore did not test audience responses to these various production choices. Previous research (Chen et al., 2017;Cummins & Chambers, 2011) suggests the audience notices production style and may associate it with credibility, but the effects of specific choices such as narrative voice, pacing, and music needs further investigation. This study also took place during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the news industry (García-Avilés, 2021) and may have affected video production choices. ...

...  Perceived quality (independent variable). Two items, based on Cummins and Chambers (2011) and Chen et al. (2017), measured participants' assessment of the video's production value, on a 7-point Likert scale. Participants were also asked to rate the overall technical quality of the video on a 7-point Likert scale. ...
... Overall, the findings of this study show that what has been known to influence users' credibility assessment online is also relevant in the context of science news videos. Regardless of its genuine truthfulness, a YouTube science news video's perceived credibility is associated with its perceived quality (positively) (Bracken, 2006;Chen et al., 2017;Cummins & Chambers, 2011;Hautz et al., 2014) and with users' age (negatively) (Metzger et al., 2011). Furthermore, users' experience with YouTube is positively associated with credibility assessment, adding to the mixed results in previous studies ([Authors], 2018;Metzger et al., 2011). ...

... Scholars have conceptualized heuristics in various ways in relation to media content. For example, scholars have conceptualized all the following as heuristics: uncivil comments posted on news stories (Prochazka, et al., 2018), how news is shared (Sundar, 2008), media brands (Urban and Schweiger, 2014), video quality (Chen, et al., 2017), labels of "opinion" or "news" on stories (Peacock, et al., 2022), and boxes beside a story that explain how it was reported . ...
... Heuristics allow people to preserve their limited cognitive energy by relying on mental shortcuts and past knowledge, rather than in-depth thoughts, to make assessments (Metzger and Flanagin, 2013). The way this works is the cue conveys to the audience something about the content, such as that it is credible (Chen, et al., 2017;Sundar, 2008) or has high journalistic quality (Prochazka, et al., 2018), based on people's prior understanding of that cue. Then people make assessment about the content based on that prior understanding. ...

... Studies have identified factors that shape credibility perceptions, such as quality of content (G. M. Chen et al., 2017;Cummins & Chambers, 2011); mistakes (Karlsson et al., 2017); and whether the content is consumed on a blog, website, etc. (Johnson & Kaye, 2014). Notably, our study contributes to this literature by examining perceptions of credibility at the domain level of the news outlet, rather than at the story level, as much research has done. ...
... On a 1 (very unlikely) to 5 (very likely) scale, participants also rated how likely or unlikely they would be to "Seek out news from [News site]," "Read a story from [News site]," "Share an article from [News site]," "Click on an article from [News site] that appeared in a Google Search result," or "Recommend news from [News site] to others" (G. M. Chen et al., 2017). In each case, the words "news site" were replaced with the name of the actual news outlet to which the participant was exposed. ...

... While those mentioned above are all contextual cues, the cues embedded in the message are of equal importance. Technical quality, "people's perception of how much effort has gone into creating the videos, as well as the technical attributes of the videos," (Chen et al., 2017;Cummins and Chambers, 2011) is positively associated with the credibility assessment of advertising videos (Hautz et al., 2014) and science videos (Michalovich and Hershkovitz, 2020). A video's technical quality consists of definition, brightness, and contrast among others, which heavily depend upon factors like blurring, jerky motion, flicker, and audio quality (Chikkerur et al., 2011). ...

Using a large-scale manual content analysis (n = 6489), we examine the presence of seven news factors in economic news across four different outlets types (i.e. popular, quality, regional, and financial newspapers). Results suggest that ... [Show full abstract]

This paper challenges the current understanding of the consideration of earnings components, particularly non-recurring items, in determining CEO cash compensation using recent and more detailed data representative of the evolving reporting of non-recurring items.
