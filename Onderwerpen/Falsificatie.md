A theory is falsiable just
in case the theory can be tested in such a way that it might turn out to be
false; in other words, when we can think of some way in which the theory
could be disproven. When a theory is disproven, we say that it has been
falsied.

scientist can test theories directly against the evidence. 
This means that they can reach consensus.

if theory has not been falsified after a lot of tries that still does not mean the theory is true.
