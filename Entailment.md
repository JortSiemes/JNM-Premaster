Entailment vergeleken met [[presuppositie]]

my wife was kidnapped - entails - someone was kidnapped
my wife was kidnapped - presupposes - i have a wife

- de entailment overleeft de negatie niet, de [[presuppositie]] wel:

My wife was nog kidnapped does NOT ential - someone was kidnapped
My wife was not kidnapped presupposes - i have a wife
